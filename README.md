# Notes on DFIR, Threat Hunting, and Malware Analysis

## Incident Response Process (Cyclical)
1. Preparation
	* Creating a response capability
	* Testing response capabilites
	* Securing Systems
	* Changes to response capabilties from lessons learned
2. Identification and Scoping
	* Alert from security tools
	* Result of threat hunting
	* Notification from user
	* Hunt for additional compromise
3. Containment/Intelligence Development
	* Identify vulnerabilities or exploits
	* Persistence Techniques
	* Lateral Movement
	* Command and Control
	* IOC developement
	* Mitigative actions to slow attacker
4. Eradication/Remediation
	* Block IPs and Domains
	* Restore systems
	* Password changes
	* Vulnerability patching
	* Prevent further adversarial access
	* Remove adversarial presence
5. Recovery
	* Improve logging (SIEM)
	* Cybersecurity Awareness
	* Segmentation
	* Password policies
	* Vulnerability management
	* Network/Endpoint visibility
6. Lessons Learned/Threat Intel Consumption
	* Verify remediations
	* Penetration tests
	* Information sharing
	* Compliance verification
